# Face Tracking Laser Project

This project uses **computer vision** to detect and track faces in real time, controlling a **laser pointer mounted on servo motors** to follow the target. It combines **OpenCV**, **YOLO object detection**, and **Arduino integration** for a fun but practical demonstration of face tracking technology.

## Features
- Real-time **face detection** using [face-recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) and **OpenCV**.
- **YOLO model** integration for detecting other objects (e.g., bowl, cup, etc.).
- Smooth tracking using **servo motors** connected via **Arduino**.
- Automatic switch between **face detection mode** and **YOLO object detection mode**.
- User-friendly control and adjustable settings.
